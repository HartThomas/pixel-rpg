*** Pixel RPG ***

** Concept **

The aim of Pixel RPG is to create a fun grid based real time pixel art rpg with a pause button and a multitude of weapons and abilities.

** Story **

Nothing concrete yet. Maybe you are a loner who lives in the mountinas and has to travel somewhere for some reason.

** Game Structure **

You start your adventure and have to fight your way through many enemies. 

** Action **

People will be able to explore and loot while encountering enemies to kill. Since it is grid based normal enemies will take up 1 square but there will also be smaller enemies who take up less and bosses that take up more space. AOE effects would hit larger enemies multiple times.
Most actions will have a timer associated with them, including movement. If you use a weapon you will have to wait for the cooldown of that weapont to use it again. Enemies will be similar. This is why we should add a pause feature, so the player can check what is going on around them. This also lets them see weaknesses and strengths of enemies, perhaps you learn more about an enemy the more you kill it.
Loot is moderately randomised

** Weapons **

- Hammer, Hits a square and deals damage to that square also does a small shockwave to neighbouring squares that also deals damage
- Sword, slashes the 3 neighbouring squares
- Bow, fires a shot towards target but it hurts the first thing it connects with, doesn't continue after connecting with something
- Dagger, much faster weapon but only connects with 1 enemy
- Large weapons with different variations of shockwave
