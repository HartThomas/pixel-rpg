** Concept **

The concept for this game comes from the Diablo 2 loot system. For some reason going back and beating the same boss over and over again is fun, because of the potential for finding new items. I want to build on that fun idea and add some new flavours to it.

** New Flavours **

I also love using JEI in Minecraft to plan out what my next moves are so I would like to add an in game Wiki that would evolve over time based on the enemies that the player had encountered. It would have, for example, a list of all the items available for beating a certain enemy which the more you beat that enemy, the more information you could find on the potential drops, even showing the percentage likelihood.
Another flavour is the idea that the way you defeat an enemy changes the drop likelihoods, so for example if you used mostly fire damage to defeat something you are more likely to find a burned item.
Once you have added the above flavours we could then add a way to edit the likelihood of seeing a certain monster, and thusly some enemies would be rarer than others which means it would be harder to find out information about those enemies.
